# CSES Problems, solved with Rust

As I learn algorithms, I used C/C++ to write them. Now that I want to migrate my skills to Rust, I will update my progress here.

Huge thanks to [EbTech](https://github.com/EbTech/rust-algorithms) for providing the algorithms and code for I/O.

## Notes

I won't do problems originally using `std::multiset` or `std::multimap` (such as the Concert Tickets problem). Can I just write a binary search inserter? Yes. Do I want to? Probably no. (Will do when the `Cursor` API of `BTreeMap` is stable (in 100 years, maybe)).
